Functions

Functions in Go can take zero or more arguments.

To make code easier to read, the variable type comes after the variable name.

For example, the following function:

func sub(x int, y int) int {
  return x-y
}

Accepts two integer parameters and returns another integer.

Here, func sub(x int, y int) int is known as the "function signature".
Assignment

We often will need to manipulate strings in our messaging app. For example, adding some personalization by using a customer's name within a template. The concat function should take two strings and smash them together.

    hello + world = helloworld

Fix the function signature of concat to reflect its behavior.
