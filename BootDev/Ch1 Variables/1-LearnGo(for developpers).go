Learn Go (for Developers)

golang gopher

This course assumes you're already familiar with programming fundamentals in at least one other language. I'll move quickly through the basics. For example, I'll explain how 
functions in Go work, but I'll assume you already know what a function is.

If you're brand new to coding I recommend starting with our Python for beginners course first.
What to expect

For most of this course you'll be writing code in your browser, but we will occasionally drop down to your local machine and use our official CLI tool (written in Go, ofc) to pass 
off lessons.

We'll be building parts of a make-believe software project: Textio! A SaaS app for sending SMS (text messages) to customers.
Assignment

Print Starting Textio server... to the console instead of hello there!.

Capitalization and punctuation matter.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Textio server...")
}
