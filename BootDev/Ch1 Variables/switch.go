Switch

Switch statements are a way to compare a value against multiple options. They are similar to if-else statements but are more concise and readable when the number of options is more than 2.

func getCreator(os string) string {
    var creator string
    switch os {
    case "linux":
        creator = "Linus Torvalds"
    case "windows":
        creator = "Bill Gates"
    case "mac":
        creator = "A Steve"
    default:
        creator = "Unknown"
    }
    return creator
}

Notice that in Go, the break statement is not required at the end of a case to stop it from falling through to the next case. The break statement is implicit in Go.

If you do want a case to fall through to the next case, you can use the fallthrough keyword.

func getCreator(os string) string {
    var creator string
    switch os {
    case "linux":
        creator = "Linus Torvalds"
    case "windows":
        creator = "Bill Gates"

    // all three of these cases will set creator to "A Steve"
    case "Mac OS":
        fallthrough
    case "Mac OS X":
        fallthrough
    case "mac":
        creator = "A Steve"

    default:
        creator = "Unknown"
    }
    return creator
}

The default case does what you'd expect: it's the case that runs if none of the other cases match.
Assignment

I know we haven't covered function syntax in depth yet, but bear with me.

Fix the bug in the billingCost function. The "basic" plan is set correctly, but we need matches for the "pro" and "enterprise" plans too. If the plan is:

    "pro", the cost should be 20.0
    "enterprise", the cost should be 50.0


*/

package main

import "fmt"

func billingCost(plan string) float64 {
	switch plan {
	case "basic":
		return 10.0
	case "pro":
		return 20.0
	case "enterprise":
		return 50.0
	default:
		return 0.0
	}
}

// don't touch below this line

func main() {
	plan := "basic"
	fmt.Printf("The cost for a %s plan is $%.2f\n", plan, billingCost(plan))
	plan = "pro"
	fmt.Printf("The cost for a %s plan is $%.2f\n", plan, billingCost(plan))
	plan = "enterprise"
	fmt.Printf("The cost for a %s plan is $%.2f\n", plan, billingCost(plan))
	plan = "free"
	fmt.Printf("The cost for a %s plan is $%.2f\n", plan, billingCost(plan))
	plan = "unknown"
	fmt.Printf("The cost for a %s plan is $%.2f\n", plan, billingCost(plan))
}
